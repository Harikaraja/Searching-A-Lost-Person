# Searching-A-Lost-Person

### Technologies Used: MongoDB, Express,  HTML, CSS, JS, and Node.js


#### Problem Statement:
	
	
   Through a mobile application, lost children can be found in a short amount of time. 
   Using an Android app, parents may locate their children without assistance
  
  They can use this app to find their child by submitting images or providing detailed information, as well as viewing a list of missing children. 
  
  In a large city, finding a child on their own is difficult. There are no current technologies available in such a circumstance, so parents must make a formal       complaint and wait a long time to retain their children, which is a waste of time.
  
  To solve the aforementioned issue, this mobile application was discovered to be simple to use when looking for a child. The suggested approach makes it simple for   parents who have lost their children to find them. 
  
  iSearch is a search engine for those who have gone missing. This application contains a database.

This application saves information about children in a database that may be used to get information about a specific child or a group of children. 
  You may also upload photos and information.
